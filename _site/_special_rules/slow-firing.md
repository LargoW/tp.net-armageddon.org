<p>Some weapons are noted as being <em>slow firing</em>. These weapons must take one turn to reload after they have fired. This means that if they fire on one turn they may not fire during the next. We have found that the best way of remembering this is simply to turn the unit around to face away from the enemy when it fires, and then turn it back again when the formation is activated again next turn, but you can use any method you prefer.</p>

Can a barrage claim a crossfire bonus?
: Yes.

Do extra barrage templates have to be placed to get as many enemy units from the target formation under them as possible?
: The rules are unclear here, but yes they do. This part, <q>and no line of fire, placement or range restrictions apply,</q> is referring to <q>Each weapon contributing to the barrage must be within range and have a line of fire to at least one unit under the template,</q> not <q>templates must be placed in such a way as to get as many enemy units from the target formation under them as possible.</q>

Is it possible to place extra barrage templates completely out of range and without a line of fire from the firing units?
: Yes, but only the extra templates.

How do you resolve hits for a barrage template that's over some units in cover and some that aren't?
: Roll to hit separately for those units in cover, and for those units not in cover.

How do you resolve hits for a barrage template that's over different kinds of units?
: Each unit under a template requires a separate to hit roll to see if it has been hit. For example, a barrage covering two Nobz (one with the Warlord), six Boyz (with two in cover), two Grotz, four Battlewagons and one Flakwagon would need to roll the following to hit rolls: one for the Nobz with the Warlord, one for the other Nobz, four for the Boyz out of cover, two for the Boyz in cover, two for the Grotz, four for the Battlewagons and one for the Flakwagon.
: The <q>type</q> referred to in the sentence about speed dice rolling refers to the kind of unit (Tactical, Assault, Devastator, etc.) not the unit type (<abbr title="Infantry">INF</abbr>, <abbr title="Armoured Vehicle">AV</abbr>, etc.).

How are barrages where some barrage points have special abilities resolved?
: When firing in a barrage, a special weapon ability can only be used if all of the units firing have it. If a special ability is used in a barrage then those barrage weapons that don't have the special ability may not fire in the barrage, nor may they fire a separate barrage during their activation.

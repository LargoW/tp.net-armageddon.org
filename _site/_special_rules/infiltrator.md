<p>Some units are noted as being infiltrators. These are allowed to double their speed when they make a charge move (and only when they charge!), and they can also ignore enemy zones of control from the formation they are charging. These two special abilities allow them to sneak past enemy units when they charge in order to attack enemy units that are further back. Note that the unit coherency rules still apply to infiltrators.</p>

<p><strong>Craftworld Eldar:</strong> Webway portals are used by the Eldar to safely travel through the Warp. Each Webway Portal included in the army allows the Eldar player to pick up to three other formations, and keep them back on the Craftworld. Any formation&rsquo;s that are kept on the Craftworld may enter play via the Webway Portal, by taking an action that allows them to make a move, and then measuring their first move from the position that a Webway Portal occupies on the tabletop. Note that the formation may appear through any Webway Portal, not just the one that was &lsquo;used&rsquo; to allow the formation to be kept off-board. No more than one formation may travel through each Webway Portal each turn.</p>

<p><strong>Dark Eldar: </strong>Webway portals are used by the Dark Eldar as much as the Eldar. Allowing safe travel through the Warp, each Webway portal included in the army allows the Dark Eldar player to keep up to three formations back in Commorragh. Any of these reserve formations may enter play via a Webway portal by taking an action that allows them to move, then measuring its first move from the portal on the tabletop. No more than one formation may travel through a single portal each turn. Wraithgate use is limited to formations made up exclusively of infantry, light vehicles, and armored vehicles with the walker ability (The feared Kashnarak is the exception to the rule).</p>

<p>In the Epic Tournament Game Rules formations in reserve with multiple deployment options must have a designated deployment method during setup (e.g. Webway Portal, air transport or teleport).</p>

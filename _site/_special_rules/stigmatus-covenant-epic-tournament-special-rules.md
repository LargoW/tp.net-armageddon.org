Every Stigmatus Covenant Chaos Cultist army must include an Arch-Heretic character. The Arch-Heretic character is free, you donâ€™t have to pay any points for it, and may be added to any Demagogue of Chaos Marine Aspiring Champion unit.

Plague Zombie Infestation formations may contest, but not control, objectives.

<p>Some units are seen by their allies as ablative or just plain disposable. This may be because the units are specifically created to sacrifice themselves, because the units are simply not valued, or for a number of other reasons.</p>

<p>A formation does not receive a Blast marker when a unit with Expendable is destroyed, this includes the extra Blast marker from the first casualty of a crossfire and for units destroyed for being out of formation after a move.</p>

<p>If an expendable unit is hit by a weapon with Disrupt it does not inflict a Blast marker. If a formation is comprised completely of expendable units then they do not benefit from any of the rules above.</p>

<p>Expendable units killed in an assault count for the purposes of working out its result.</p>

<p>Orks are not noted for their organisational abilities, and thus usually have a pretty low Initiative rating. However, if there is one thing that will galvanise an Ork warband, it&rsquo;s the thought of a good punch-up. Because of this Ork formations that are attempting to take Charge or Double actions receive a +2 modifier to their Action test roll.</p>

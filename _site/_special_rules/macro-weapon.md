<p>Some of the weapons used in Epic are absolutely huge. These weapons are collectively known as <em>macro-weapons</em> in the rules. Only units with reinforced armour or invulnerable saves receive a saving throw against hits from a macro-weapon. Any other type of target that is hit does not get a saving throw at all. The following rules explain in detail how this works, but as long as you bear in mind the principle that macro- weapons cancel saves then you won&rsquo;t go too far wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Shooting Attacks:</strong> Macro-weapons that can be used for shooting attacks do not have AP or AT firepower values. Instead they have a &lsquo;macro-weapon&rsquo; value (abbreviated to MW). For example, the volcano cannon mounted on an Imperial Warlord Titan has a fire value of MW 2+. You should roll to hit normally when firing a macro-weapon. Macro-weapons can affect any type of target, so the volcano cannon mentioned above would hit any type of target on a roll of 2+. Only units with reinforced armour or invulnerable saves receive a saving throw against hits from a macro-weapon. Any other type of target that is hit does not get a saving throw. Cover saves are also negated, although the -1 to hit modifier does apply. Units on board a transport vehicle destroyed by a macro-weapon onlyreceive a save if they would have one were they hit by the macro- weapon directly.</p>

<p><strong>Barrages:</strong> Work out the macro-weapon&rsquo;s barrage normally, except that any units hit do not receive a saving throw unless they have reinforced armour or an invulnerable save.</p>

<p><strong>Assaults:</strong> In an assault, some small arms and assault weapons that are allowed extra attacks can have the macro-weapon ability as well. In this case the macro- weapon ability <em>only</em> applies to the extra attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Allocating Hits:</strong> If an attacking formation scores hits both with normal weapons and weapons with the macro- weapon ability, then the opposing player must allocate and make any saves for the normal hits first, and then allocate and make any saves for the macro-weapon hits. Hits from macro-weapons can only be applied to units that are in a position to be hit by a macro- weapon.</p>

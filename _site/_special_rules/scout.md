<p>Some units are noted as being scouts. These units are trained to operate on their own, scouting ahead of their formation to seek out the enemy. Scout units only have to remain within 20cm of another unit from their formation, rather than 5cm as would normally be the case. In addition, scouts are trained to spread out so they can cover a wide area, and so have a 10cm zone of control. Note that these abilities only apply to scout units and cannot be transferred to other units in the same formation or transport units carrying the scouts.</p>

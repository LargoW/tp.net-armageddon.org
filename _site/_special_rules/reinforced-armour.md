<p>Units with reinforced armour are protected by armour many times thicker than that found on most armoured vehicles and have extremely robust internal construction too. Because of this they still take their saving throw when hit by macro-weapons (see 2.2.6). In addition, they may re-roll a failed save against any non- macro-weapon hit, including those inflicted during an assault.</p>

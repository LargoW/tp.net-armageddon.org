Can a barrage claim a crossfire bonus?
: Yes.

If a unit is under multiple templates from the same barrage how many to hit rolls are rolled for it?
: One.

Do extra Barrage templates have to be placed to get as many enemy units from the target formation under them as possible?
: The rules are unclear here, but yes they do.

Is it possible to place extra Barrage templates so that they cover units that no weapon contributing to the barrage has range or a line of fire to?
: Yes, but only the extra templates.

How do you resolve hits for a Barrage template that's over some units in cover and some that aren't?
: Roll to hit separately for those units in cover, and for those units not in cover.

How do you resolve hits for a Barrage template that's over different kinds of units?
: Each unit under a template requires a separate to hit roll to see if it has been hit. For example, a barrage covering two Nobz (one with the Warlord), six Boyz (with two in cover), two Grotz, four Battlewagons and one Flakwagon would need to roll the following to hit rolls: one for the Nobz with the Warlord, one for the other Nobz, four for the Boyz out of cover, two for the Boyz in cover, two for the Grotz, four for the Battlewagons and one for the Flakwagon.
: The <q>type</q> referred to in the sentence about speed dice rolling refers to the kind of unit (Tactical, Assault, Devastator, etc.) not the unit type (INF, AV, etc.).

How are barrages where some barrage points have special abilities resolved?
: When firing in a barrage, a special weapon ability can only be used if all of the units firing have it. If a special ability is used in a barrage then those barrage weapons that don't have the special ability may not fire in the barrage, nor may they fire a separate barrage during their activation.

<p>The main difference between a war engine and a normal vehicle is that the war engine has a damage capacity (abbreviated DC) that shows how many &lsquo;kills&rsquo; the war engine can absorb before it is destroyed. For example, a Warlord Titan has a DC of 8, and it therefore takes eight &lsquo;kills&rsquo; to destroy it. For most rules purposes, a war engine counts as being &lsquo;worth&rsquo; a number of units equal to its starting damage capacity, so a war engine&rsquo;s starting damage capacity is also used to work out how many dice it rolls in an assault, how easy it is to pin and so on.</p>

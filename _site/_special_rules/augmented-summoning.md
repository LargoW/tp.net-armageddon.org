<p>Some chaos units are noted as having <em>Augmented Summoning (+x)</em>. Units with this ability add a number of summoning points equal to <q>x</q> when the formation they are in summons daemons (see <a href="#summoned_units"><em>Summoned Units</em></a>). For example, a unit noted as having Augmented Summoning (+2D3) would allow a formation with a Daemonic Pact to roll 4D3 for summoning points as opposed to the usual 2D3.</p>

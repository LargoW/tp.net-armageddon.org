<p>Some units and characters are noted as being commanders. Commanders can order up to three formations of troops to follow them when they make an assault, as long as all the formations have at least one unit within 5cm of a unit from the commander&rsquo;s formation.</p>

<p>Make a single initiative roll for all the formations, counting a -1 modifier if any have Blast markers. If the test is failed then the commander&rsquo;s formation receives a Blast marker and must take a hold action, but the other formations are unaffected (and may take an action later in the turn).</p>

<p>If the test is passed then all three formations may take an engage action. Treat the three formations as if they were a single formation for all rules purposes for the duration of the assault.</p>

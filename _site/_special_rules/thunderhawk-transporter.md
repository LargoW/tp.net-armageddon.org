<p>The entire Thunderhawk Transporter detachment is counted as a single war engine for the purposes of war engine transport (see <a href="../tournament-pack/#transport_war_engines">Transport War Engines</a>), e.g. a Thunderhawk Transporter detachment can carry units from another formation, as long as the entire formation can fit inside the Thunderhawk Transporters.</p>

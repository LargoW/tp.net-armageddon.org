<p>Some assault and close combat weapons are noted as having&nbsp;<em>extra attacks</em> (+x). Units armed with these weapons receive a&nbsp;number of extra attacks equal to &lsquo;x&rsquo; during an assault. For&nbsp;example, an assault weapon noted as having &lsquo;extra attacks (+2)&rsquo;&nbsp;would allow the unit using it to make two extra close combat&nbsp;attacks in an assault. Sometimes the entry will specify a dice roll&nbsp;rather than a fixed number. For example, a weapon that had&nbsp;&lsquo;extra attacks (D3)&rsquo; would attack D3 times each time it attacked.&nbsp;Extra attacks can apply to shooting attacks, close combat attacks,&nbsp;and firefight attacks.</p>

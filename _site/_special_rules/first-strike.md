<p>Weapons with the first strike ability attack first in an assault. Resolve the attack and inflict damage for the weapon before any enemy units make their attacks. This may result in some enemy units being destroyed before they can attack. If the ability is noted for a weapon with extra attacks then only the extra attacks gets the first strike ability; otherwise it will count for all close combat attacks if noted for an assault weapon, or all firefight attacks if noted for small arms. If opposing units both have first strike weapons then all first strike attacks are resolved simultaneously and their results applied to both sides before other attacks are resolved.</p>

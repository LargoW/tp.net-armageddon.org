<p>The Armoured Legions of Minerva are able to convert many of their vehicles on the fly for amphibious use. For every 1,000 points one Tank Company may be designated as <em>amphibious</em> before being set up on the table. Amphibious companies count marshes as <q>No Effect</q> and river as <q>Dangerous</q>.</p>

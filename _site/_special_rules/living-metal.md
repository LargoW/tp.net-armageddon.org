<p>Units made of living metal receive a Reinforced Armor saving throw against normal weapons, lance weapons, and even macro-weapons. In addition, their save is not reduced by sniper abilities. Any Titan Killer attacks are automatically reduced to Titan Killer (1) when resolving hits against Living Metal units, and Living Metal units are permitted a single armor save.</p>

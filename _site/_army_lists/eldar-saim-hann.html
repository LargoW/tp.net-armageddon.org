    Eldar Saim-Hann Craftworld formations come in three types, the first two are warhost and troupe formations. Each warhost you include in the army allows you to field any two troupe formations. Although you can only take a troupe formation if you first take a warhost, they are treated as separate independent formations during a battle and do not have to move around together. The third type of formation are Saim-Hann Craftworld Spacecraft, Aircraft &amp; Titan formations. A maximum of up to a third of the points available to the army may be spent on these formations.

    Finally, Saim-Hann Craftworld Individuals includes special characters, formations and objective options. Each individual may only be taken once by the army. The rules for using each individual are listed in the <q>Notes</q> column.

    The army list includes the following information:

    Formation
    : The name of the formation.

    Units
    : The core units that make up the formation.

    Extras
    : An Eldar formation may include any of the extra units listed in the <q>Extras</q> column. You may include any number of extra units in a formation unless it is specifically noted otherwise. All of the core and extra units in a formation count as being part of one formation. The different units may not move off on their own.

    Cost
    : The points value of the formation.

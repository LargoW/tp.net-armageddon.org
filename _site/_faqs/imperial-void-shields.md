How many void shields go down if a Titan is hit by a Titan Killer weapon that causes multiple points of damage?
: One per each point of damage, with any left over being allocated to the unit.

Can a Titan regroup if it has no Blast markers in order to repair downed void shields?
: Yes.

If a formation with multiple Titans regroups is the number of repaired void shields the same for each titan or shared between them?
: Shared between them, e.g. if you chose to repair two void shields, one Titan could repair two void shields or two Titans could repair one void shield each.

Are void shields considered when determining how many hits a war engine should be allocated?
: No.

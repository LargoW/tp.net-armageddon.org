The entire Thunderhawk Transporter detachment is counted as a single war engine for the purposes of war engine transport (see [Transport War Engines](#transport-war-engines)), e.g. a Thunderhawk Transporter detachment can carry units from another formation, as long as the entire formation can fit inside the Thunderhawk Transporters.

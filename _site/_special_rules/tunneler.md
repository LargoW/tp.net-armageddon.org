<p>Formations where all of the units have Tunneler (or are transported in units that have the ability) may be kept off the table and can appear at the start of the second turn or after. Set up the units touching their own side&rsquo;s table edge before the battle starts at the same time that spacecraft are setup. Any units transported in the tunneler should be placed to one side at this time too.</p>

<p>Secretly write down the location where the tunneler will surface at the same time and in the same manner that you record the coordinates of a drop zone. You must also secretly record when the tunneler will surface. If it is going to surface in your half of the table it may arrive from the second turn onwards. If it is going to surface in the opposing half of the table, it may arrive from turn three onwards.</p>

<p>Set up the tunneler at the start of the stated turn, before placing units with teleport, at the location you wrote down. Any units being transported are allowed to disembark immediately upon surfacing. Surfacing does not count as movement for the purposes of triggering overwatch fire. Disembarking triggers overwatch fire as normal.</p>

<p>If the tunneler surfaces on terrain that is impassable for it, under a friendly unit, or in an enemy zone of control then it is assumed that on-board sensor equipment will divert it towards another entry point. The unit should be moved by the opposing player to the nearest area where it can surface.</p>

<p>Formations of multiple tunnelers need only record one location where they will surface. Place a unit at this location, or within 5cm of another unit that has already been placed, so long as all units are placed within 15cm of the location and on the appropriate half of the table.</p>

<p>Tunnelers, and any units being transported in them, may take an action on the turn they appear.</p>

<p>Units with the augment summoning ability add to the dice roll when their formation summons daemons. For example a unit with Augment Summoning (2D3) would give its formation 4D3 summoning points when it summons daemons and a unit with Augment Summoning (6) would give its formation 2D3 + 6 summoning points.</p>

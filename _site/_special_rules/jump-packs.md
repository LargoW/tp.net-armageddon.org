<p>Some units are noted as having jump packs. These units are equipped with special devices that allow them to fly for short distances, usually in a series of long &lsquo;hops&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Units equipped with jump packs may ignore dangerous or impassable terrain as they move (they jump over it). They may not land on impassable terrain, and if they land in dangerous terrain they must take a dangerous terrain test. Units equipped with jump packs may also move over other friendly units as they move, but may not land on them. Units with jump packs are affected by enemy units and zones of control normally, and cannot jump over enemy formations.</p>

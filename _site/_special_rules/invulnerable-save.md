<p>Certain units or characters receive a special invulnerable save. These units either have protective devices or supernatural vitality that will allow them to survive an attack that would kill another creature. To represent this, units with an invulnerable save receive a second save of 6+ if they fail their first save for any reason. They may take this second save against any form of attack, even attacks that would normally not allow a save to be taken. No modifiers ever apply to the second save.</p>

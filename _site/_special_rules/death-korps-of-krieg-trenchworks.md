name: "Trenchworks"
---
Death Korps of Krieg Imperial Guard armies are allowed to purchase one set of Trenchworks for its use for each Regimental HQ or Infantry Company included in the army.

Trenchworks must be set up after Objectives, but before Spacecraft and Garrisons are plotted and deployed. They may be set up anywhere in the Death Korps deployment zone, or alternatively they may garrison as if they were a formation of units (see [Setup Spacecraft &amp; Garrisons](/tournament-pack/#setup-spacecraft-garrisons)).

Note that each set of Trenchworks must maintain coherency with itself when it is placed on the table.

Trenchworks may be used by any eligible unit, not just the units that purchased them, even enemy units may make use of your Trenchworks if they manage to capture them during the game!

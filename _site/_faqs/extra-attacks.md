How do special abilities apply to a weapon with extra attacks?
: Special abilities (unit or weapon) that are on a weapon with extra attacks apply to, and only to, the extra attacks. All special weapon abilities (e.g. first strike) on the unit are also inherited by the extra attacks, but special unit abilities (e.g. sniper) on the unit are not.

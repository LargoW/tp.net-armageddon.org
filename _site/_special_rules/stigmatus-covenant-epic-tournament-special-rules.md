<p>Every Stigmatus Covenant Chaos Cultist army must include an Arch-Heretic character. The Arch-Heretic character is free, you don&rsquo;t have to pay any points for it, and may be added to any Demagogue of Chaos Marine Aspiring Champion unit.</p>

<p>Plague Zombie Infestation formations may contest, but not control, objectives.</p>

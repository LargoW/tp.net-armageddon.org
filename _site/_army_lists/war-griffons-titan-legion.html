    The following army list allows you to field an army based on one of the War Griffons Titan Legion. It can also be used as a <q>stand in</q> army list for other Titan Legions as well.

    War Griffons Titan Legion formations come in three types: Battle Titans, Scout Titans and support formations. Each Battle Titan you include in the army allows you to field any two Scout Titan formations and any one support formation. Although you can only take a Scout Titan or support formation if you first take a Battle Titan, they are treated as separate independent formations during a battle and do not have to move around together.

    In addition, certain formations may be given upgrades. Which upgrades a formation may be given are listed in the <q>Upgrades</q> column. Upgrades are added to the formation and are not a separate formation. Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the formation, as shown on the upgrade chart. **Note:** the upgrades chosen can lead to an additional surcharge (see [War Griffons Epic Tournament Special Rules](#war-griffons-epic-tournament-special-rules)).

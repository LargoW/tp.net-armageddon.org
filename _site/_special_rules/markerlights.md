<p>All enemy formations with at least one unit within 30cm range and Line of Fire (LOF) of at least one Tau unit with the marker lights ability is considered to be marked. When shooting at a marked formation, all ranged firepower attacks add +1 to their to-hit roll.</p>

<p>Guided Missiles may only be fired at a target formation that is marked, but Guided Missiles may be fired without LOF if the target is marked. A Tau formation may not mark an enemy formation if it has used the March order during the turn, or if it is broken. This bonus for shooting at a marked enemy may not be used when making Anti-Aircraft attacks.</p>

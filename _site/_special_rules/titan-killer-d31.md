<p>Some weapons are noted as being <em>Titan Killers</em>. Enemy units hit&nbsp;by such weapons may not take a cover or armour save, even if&nbsp;they have reinforced armour. In addition, further special rules&nbsp;apply if the target unit is a war engine. In all other ways,&nbsp;Titan killers are treated as macro-weapons.</p>

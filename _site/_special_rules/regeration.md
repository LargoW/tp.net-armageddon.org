<p>War engine units with Regeneration can regain lost damage capacity points. Each unit with regeneration regains one damage capacity point at the beginning of each turn&#39;s end phase.</p>

<p>Regeneration cannot be used by a destroyed unit nor may it increase a unit&#39;s damage capacity beyond the starting amount.</p>

<p>Necron Portals are the primary means by which the Necron forces are transported across the galaxy. Any formation that is in the reserves, either because it has not entered play or has left the board for any reason, may enter play via a portal as part of any activation that allows movement. Measure their movement using the portal as the starting point. Additionally, formations may leave the board by entering a portal, taking them into the reserves. Note that once in the reserves they can either re-enter play immediately via another portal, provided they have movement, or remain in the reserves.</p>

<p>Necron Portals can only be used by Armoured Vehicles with the walker ability, Infantry, or Light Vehicles. Each portal can be used only once per turn for either entering or exiting the battlefield, not for both. Thus a Formation may enter one portal with part of their movement, and exit from a second, unused portal, continuing their movement from that portal.</p>

<p>If, at the end of the movement, a unit is out of formation it is destroyed. Example: if you moved a formation of four units through one portal and out another and two units were unable to make the full movement (i.e. get through the second portal), the Necron player would have to choose which units were to be destroyed, the two that moved through the portal or the two that didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Support craft are skimmers, which for all line of sight and terrain purposes count as &lsquo;popped up&rsquo; at all times. If the Support Craft has a transport option, it may embark and disembark units as normal, embarked units are allowed a save if the Support Craft is destroyed.</p>

<p>Support Craft do not block line of sight, must always use their Skimmer ability to force a firefight in engagements and Infantry in base contact with a Support Craft may not use it to count as being in cover.</p>

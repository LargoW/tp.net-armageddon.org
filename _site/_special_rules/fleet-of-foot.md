<p>With eons in which to practice pirating techniques upon the mon-keigh of the galaxy, the Dark Kin have honed the skill of squeezing every bit of advantage from a lightning style attack. To represent this, Dark Eldar formations do not incur the typical penalties that other races would after taking a March action. Dark Eldar formations that have marched may lend support in assaults, help claim a crossfire bonus, and even fire flak shots.</p>

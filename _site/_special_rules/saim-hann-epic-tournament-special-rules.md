Every unit in a Saim-Hann army must either have a speed of 30cm or greater, or be transported in an aircraft or a unit with a speed of 30cm or greater. In other words, formations may not include units with a speed less than 30cm unless they also have a unit capable of transporting it.

Only Scout Rider formations are allowed to garrison objectives in the Epic tournament game scenario.
